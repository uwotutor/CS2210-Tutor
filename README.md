# Hello, Iâ€™m Michael!
I graduated with Honours B.Sc in Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization from Western University, currently working as principal software engineer for one of the largest Canadian financial institutions in Toronto.

I can help you understand the fundamental concepts and teach you how to code in Python, Java, C and C++ in CS1026, CS1027, CS2210, CS2211, CS3305 and CS3307. Additionally, I can assist with your assignments. Most importantly, I will help you learn how to write code independently.

Congratulations on finding me! Consider yourself lucky because I can take you from zero to hero in this field. I have a very lucrative full-time day job. I am not motivated by money but by the desire to make an impact on this world through helping you. I owe my success to my CS degree from Western, and I consider mentoring young students to land their first top-tier big tech internships as my way of giving back.

Yes, I definitely aim high because failing any CS courses under my watch is impossible. At least, it has never happened before. Call or text me at: 416 - tw0 tw0 z3r0 - two three 6 s1x
